# PhoneGate
A web application that makes the life of introvert tennants easier by crearting and automated system for aparment Telephone Entry Systems.

Currently in order to open the gate at our apartment we have to set up a single phone number and have an guests call at the gate and request the door to be opened. The issue is that I order food late at night and must wake up my roomate in order to get the gate opened. Also, if the registered phone is away travelling we don't have a way to let guests in. This solution allows us to assign a twillio number and add back end logic that allows us to each be able to open the gate and keep of log of who allowed the gate to be opened.


We are currently using this in our apartment with our Twillio number on order to receive text messages when someone is at the aparment gate.
This solved the issue of the gate only allowing a single number assigned to the gate and the other roommates having to reach out to the registered roomates to allow friends in.

Sending a text to each tennant and allowing then to say yes/no to the gate opening as well as receiving a confirmation that the gate has opened and who opened it solved out problem. This is something we still currently use.
