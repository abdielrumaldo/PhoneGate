# PhoneGate
A web application that makes the life of introvert tennants easier by crearting and automated system for aparment Telephone Entry Systems.

We are currently using this in our apartment with our Twillio number on order to receive text messages when someone is at the aparment gate.
This solved the issue of the gate only allowing a single number assigned to the gate and the other roommates having to reach out to the registered roomates to allow friends in.

Sending a text to each tennant and allowing then to say yes/no to the gate opening as well as receiving a confirmation that the gate has opened and who opened it solved out problem. This is something we still currently use.
